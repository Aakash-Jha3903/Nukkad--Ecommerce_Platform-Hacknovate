# 🏘️ Nukkad — Bridging the Gap Between Local Shops and Customers

**Nukkad** is a hyperlocal e-commerce platform designed to connect customers with nearby local stores. Inspired by the need to support small businesses in the face of rising competition from e-commerce giants (like Zepto and Blinkit), Nukkad empowers shopkeepers to promote their unique offerings, streamline deliveries, and digitally engage their community.
This project was originally conceptualized and developed during my **3rd semester** as a way to apply real-world problem solving through technology—marking an early milestone in my journey of building smart, impactful solutions.
